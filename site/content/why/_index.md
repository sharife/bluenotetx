      Only 1 out of every 5 cancer patients currently has access to cancer-specific mental health care to alleviate their distress.

      Depression and anxiety can make it hard for cancer patients to stick with treatment and increase their time in the hospital as they undergo cancer care. Emerging evidence in breast cancer patients suggests that it may be important to manage cancer-related distress to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.

      In addition, few patients have access to cancer-specific mental health care. **Only 1 out of every 5 cancer patients currently has access to cancer-specific mental health care to alleviate their distress.** Cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) has been tailored to cancer patients and shown in numerous clinical studies to improve emotional well-being, physical health and overall survival.

    text: Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) is an evidence-based protocol adapted from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and relaxation stress management, designed specifically for patients with cancer. CBSM was originally developed by a clinical psychologist, Michael Antoni, Ph.D. CBSM has been studied since the early â€™90s, and has been published in multiple clinical studies.
