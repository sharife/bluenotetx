*Last Updated: October 23, 2020*

We are excited to share our digital therapeutics with you. We established core principles from our founding that are focused on transparency, protection and uses of personal information. As we build our products and services, these core principles drive our product and service requirements, processes and audit readiness.
We want you to be aware of what information we do and do not collect, why we collect it, what we use it for, and how we store it. We believe strongly in your ability to control the use of your information. You can ask us to review, modify, or delete your data. Most importantly, among our core principles at Blue Note is that we will use your information to improve your experience, advance research in the field of cancer and to improve our product for future cancer patients.  

This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Blue Note Therapeutics, Inc. and our subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively "Blue Note," "we", “us” or "our") and how we handle personal information that we collect through our digital properties that link to this Privacy Policy, including our websites and mobile applications, such as our Attune™ device (collectively, the “Services”).  Blue Note may provide additional or supplemental privacy policies to individuals for specific products or services that we offer. These supplemental privacy policies will govern how we may process personal information in the context of the specific product or service.  

In some instances, health care providers, health plans or insurance companies, or other companies (collectively, “business customers”) may engage us to provide certain Services for the benefit of their patients and/or insureds pursuant to a contract that restricts our use of their PHI in accordance with HIPAA.  In such cases, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the PHI that we handle, which is handled as described in the privacy statement of the relevant business customer.  For information about the business customer responsible for your PHI, if any, and how to contact the business customer about its privacy practices, please contact us at +1 415-200-3697 or help@bluenotetx.com.  

Users of the Services may have the opportunity to refer caregivers, friends or other contacts to us and share their contact information with us. Please do not refer someone to us or share their contact information with us unless you have their permission to do so.
