    text: Cancer-related distress, which can be defined as any unpleasant feeling, emotion, or experience that affects a cancer patient's quality of life or ability to cope with cancer diagnosis and treatment, affects millions of people. Fewer than half of those who experience cancer-related distress have access to the mental health care they need to find relief. Blue Note Therapeutics is working to close this gap.
