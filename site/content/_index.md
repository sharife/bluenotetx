BlueNote may provide additional or supplemental privacy policies to individuals for specific products or services that we offer at the time we collect personal information.

We are excited to share our digital therapeutics with you.  We established core principles from our founding that are focused on transparency, protection and uses of personal information.  As we build our products and services, these core principles drive our product and service requirements, processes and audit readiness.

We believe strongly in your ability to control the use of your information.  You can ask us to review, modify, or delete your data.  Most importantly, among our core principles at BlueNote is that we will use your information to improve your experience, advance research in the field of cancer and to improve our product for future cancer patients.

**Information we obtain from social media platforms.** 
We may maintain pages for BlueNote on social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Instagram, or other third party platforms. When you visit or interact with our pages on those platforms, the platform provider’s privacy policy will apply to your interactions and their collection, use and processing of your personal information. You or the platforms may provide us with information through the platform, and we will treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 


**Cookies and Other Information Collected by Automated Means**   

We and our service providers may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and activity occurring on or through the Service, including but not limited,  your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, device identifier, browser type, screen resolution, IP address, the website you visited before browsing to our website, general location information such as city, state or geographic area; information about your use of and actions on the Service, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and length of access; and other personal information.  Our service providers and business partners may collect this type of information over time and across third-party websites and mobile applications. 

On our webpages, this information is collected using cookies, browser web storage (also known as locally stored objects, or “LSOs”), web beacons, and similar technologies, and our emails may also contain web beacons. In our mobile application, we may collect this information directly or through our use of third-party software development kits (“SDKs”). SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly from our App.

A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. Browser web storage, or LSOs, are used for similar purposes as cookies. Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. A “web beacon,” also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF, is typically used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of our websites. A SDK is third-party computer code that we may incorporate into our mobile applications that may be used for a variety of purposes, including to provide us with analytics regarding the use of our mobile applications, to integrate with social media, add features or functionality to our app, or to facilitate online advertising.

Web browsers may offer users of our websites or mobile apps the ability to disable receiving certain types of cookies; however, if cookies are disabled, some features or functionality of our websites may not function correctly. Please see the “Targeted online advertising” section for information about how to exercise choice regarding the use of browsing behavior for purposes of targeted advertising.
