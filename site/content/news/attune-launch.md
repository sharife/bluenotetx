San Francisco, CA – (December 7, 2020) – Blue Note Therapeutics today announced the launch of attune™, the first prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) for the treatment of symptoms of anxiety and depression related to cancer in adult patients. Attune is currently available through select institutions under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) enforcement policy for digital health devices for treating psychiatric disorders during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency. 


Founded by a team of scientists, tech innovators and, most importantly, cancer patients, Blue Note Therapeutics aims to make mental health care available and accessible to any cancer patient at any time via mobile device. Attune is the company’s lead product and the first PDT for cancer patients to apply Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM), a non-digital behavioral intervention that has been used and studied extensively in cancer patients for more than 20 years. 

“Almost everyone with cancer experiences some kind of psychological distress, and whether it’s anxiety, depression, or other symptoms, it can be harmful to the patient’s mental and physical health and impact their treatment progression,” said Geoffrey Eich, CEO of Blue Note Therapeutics. “We are grateful to the FDA for allowing companies like Blue Note Therapeutics to make digital mental health solutions available to patients in need during this public health crisis.” 

Blue Note Therapeutics entered into a licensing agreement with the University of Miami to develop and commercialize a digital version of CBSM, now known as attune. Through attune, patients can access personalized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation therapy, stress management techniques, and coping strategies as an adjunct to other medical treatments for cancer. 
 
“Cancer patients experience heightened levels of stress, anxiety, and depression due to their diagnosis and treatment. This is an area of great unmet need, which has only been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Patricia Ganz, MD, an oncologist and Director of Cancer Prevention and Control Research at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at UCLA. “We look forward to partnering with Blue Note Therapeutics to evaluate this prescription digital therapeutic to help alleviate the symptoms of cancer-related distress.”


PDTs are a therapeutic class that use FDA-approved software to directly treat diseases and conditions, such as cancer-related distress. Similar to prescription medicines, PDTs must also demonstrate safety and efficacy in randomized clinical trials. In 2020, the FDA issued guidance to expand the availability of digital health therapeutic devices, such as PDTs, that may improve consumer mental health and wellbeing and reduce user and healthcare provider contact and potential exposure to COVID-19 during the pandemic.

Attune received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation in June for the treatment of symptoms of anxiety and depression related to cancer in adult patients. Attune is not approved by the FDA for any indication. 

Studies and pilot programs will begin at sites across the United States in the coming weeks. Research institutions, cancer centers, and community oncology practices who are interested in becoming an attune pilot site can visit www.attunerx.com to request more information.

**About Cancer-Related Distress**  
There are about 18 million cancer patients and survivors in the United States today. Nearly half of all cancer patients experience psychosocial distress, anxiety, or depression. If left untreated, these feelings can lower a cancer survivors’ quality of life and may negatively affect survival. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has proposed guidelines for the delivery of mental health care services in oncology, which include screening patients for signs of distress and implementing a treatment plan to address these needs with a mental health care specialist. Unfortunately, fewer than half of patients who experience cancer-related distress, which can be defined as any unpleasant feeling, emotion, or experience that affects a patient’s quality of life or ability to cope with cancer diagnosis and treatment, are referred to mental health care specialists., Prescription digital therapeutics that help to treat cancer-related distress have the potential to help close this cancer treatment gap.
