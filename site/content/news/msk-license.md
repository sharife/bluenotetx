San Francisco, CA – (December 30, 2020) – Dr. Breibart is a board-certified psychiatrist whose expertise focuses on the psychiatric aspects of pain, symptom control, and palliative care in cancer patients. He has been Chief of the Psychiatry Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center since 1996 and Vice Chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences since 2009, and currently serves as Chair of the Department. He also serves as the psychiatric liaison to the Hepatobiliary Disease Management Team and the Palliative Medicine Service and as a member of the Brain Tumor Center faculty.


Dr. Jimmie C. Holland (1929-2018) was considered a founder of the field of psycho-oncology, which combines oncology and psychiatry. It is increasingly considered a vital part of comprehensive cancer care, largely thanks to her work. Dr. Holland joined MSKCC in 1977, as the inaugural Chief of the Psychiatry Service, the first such service at a cancer center anywhere in the world.
