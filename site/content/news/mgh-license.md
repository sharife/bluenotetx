Boston​ ​and San Francisco, October 6th, 2020​ - Blue Note Therapeutics, a prescription digital therapeutics company, has entered into a license agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to further develop and commercialize a digital therapeutic prototype created specifically for patients with acute myeloid leukemia by researchers from the MGH Cancer Outcomes Research and Education Program. A randomized head-to-head clinical trial is currently underway to measure the prototype’s ability to improve the physical and psychological symptoms patients with acute myeloid leukemia experience during hospitalization for their leukemia care, as compared to usual care.

**About Cancer-Related Distress**  
There are about 18 million cancer patients and survivors in the United States today [1]. Nearly half of all cancer patients experience psychosocial distress, anxiety, or depression [2]. If left untreated, these feelings can lower a cancer survivors’ quality of life and may negatively affect survival [3]. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has proposed guidelines for the delivery of mental health care services in oncology, which include screening patients for signs of distress and implementing a treatment plan to address these needs with a mental health care specialist [4]. Unfortunately, fewer than half of patients who experience cancer-related distress, which can be defined as any unpleasant feeling, emotion, or experience that affects a patient’s quality of life or ability to cope with cancer diagnosis and treatment, are referred to mental health care specialists [5,6]. Prescription digital therapeutics that help to treat cancer-related distress have the potential to help close this cancer treatment gap.
