Blue Note Therapeutics, Inc., a prescription digital therapeutics company, has entered into a licensing agreement with the University of Miami to develop and commercialize a prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) from a cancer-specific face-to-face behavioral intervention created and studied by Michael H. Antoni, PhD and Frank J. Penedo, PhD.  

Dr. Antoni is a professor in the Department of Psychology and member of the Cancer Control program at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami. Dr. Penedo is a professor in the Department of Psychology and is the Director of Cancer Survivorship and Center Associate Director for Survivorship and Translational Behavioral Sciences at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami.  

Blue Noteâ€™s lead PDT candidate based on this intervention, BNT001, received Breakthrough Device Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June 2020 for the treatment of symptoms of anxiety and depression related to cancer in adult patients. Studies and pilot programs will be underway soon at sites across the United States.
