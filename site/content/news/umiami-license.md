**About Cancer-Related Distress**  
There are about 18 million cancer patients and survivors in the United States today [1]. Nearly half of all cancer patients experience psychosocial distress, anxiety, or depression [2]. If left untreated, these feelings can lower a cancer survivors’ quality of life and may negatively affect survival [3]. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has proposed guidelines for the delivery of mental health care services in oncology, which include screening patients for signs of distress and implementing a treatment plan to address these needs with a mental health care specialist [4]. Unfortunately, fewer than half of patients who experience cancer-related distress, which can be defined as any unpleasant feeling, emotion, or experience that affects a patient’s quality of life or ability to cope with cancer diagnosis and treatment, are referred to mental health care specialists [5,6]. Prescription digital therapeutics that help to treat cancer-related distress have the potential to help close this cancer treatment gap.
